# This is short notes from clean code by Robert Martin


The only valid measurement of code quality: WTFs/Minute

[BOOK] Implementation Patterns
A Fragile Permise, good code matters

Why are programmer so slow?

-> Start first make a mess, team gets slower and slower as mess become bigger and bigger.

-> We go slow because we make messes, why do we make mess in the first place? the desire to go first.

code gets working is the half of the job, once the code works thats the time to clean it. No body does clean code first, it is just to hard to get code works. Once the code works its create mess, human does not think in straight line, our thinking is complex and not organized.

We need to clean after its working. It might need the same amount of time its take to write it.
But most people treat the works is done when it works.

Its a attitude to build, clean/refactoring just as important as getting code works.


The only way to go fast it to go well.

What is clean code?

clean code does one thing well.
the function should do one thing and one thing well.

[book] object oriented software design with application
clean code is simple and direct, Clean code reads like well-written prose.
clean code looks like written by someone who cares. 

    what is your job?
    you may think that your job is to write code that works, but thats not your job, that only half of your job, more importantly thats least half of your job. least important part.
    more important part is to write in a such a way that other people can read/understand/maintain make works of the code.
