## Me


After graduating from [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/) in Computer Science & Engineering, I joined a local software company [TigerIT](https://www.tigerit.com/). A few months later I moved to Singapore to join  [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/) as a Software Engineer. Currently, I am working at ByteDance in Singapore as a Backend Software Engineering for more than a year now. 

## Work
### Current Work
In my current role, I build backend services for the Data Platform team. Most of my working hours are spend on writing code to develop feature, improve existing service, design discussion, code review, resolving on-call issue, etc. Most of the work is toward making services reliable and scalable while trying to keep latency acceptably low. Using Golang to build microservices where services communicate using HTTP/Thrift protocol. Redis and MySQL have mostly used databases in our system
