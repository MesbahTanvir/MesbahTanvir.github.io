In my current role, I mostly built backend services for Data Platform team. Most of my working ours are spend on writting code to develop feature, improve existing service, design discussion, code review, resolving oncall issue, etc. Most of the work is toward making services reliable and scalable while trying to keep latency in acceptably low. Using golang to build microservices where services communicate using HTTP/Thrift protocol. Redis and MySQL are mostly used database in our system
