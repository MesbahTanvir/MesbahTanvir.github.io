## Sharing knowledge improve's the world

I am a software engineering for a quiet some time. I have been learning lot of new concept, tools, technology, professionalism and many more. I believe Sharing what I've learned will help others and also improve my understanding on this topic as well. I am giving it a shot, so here it is my new journal ...

## Moving forward 

I will add new post whenever I learn something interesting or I feel worth sharing, so no commitment. But rest assure, I will try my best to add interesting aspect of software engineering in my journal.
