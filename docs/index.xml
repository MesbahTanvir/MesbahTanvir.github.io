      <description>Sharing knowledge improve&amp;rsquo;s the world I am a software engineering for a quiet some time. I have been learning lot of new concept, tools, technology, professionalism and many more. I believe Sharing what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned will help others and also improve my understanding on this topic as well. I am giving it a shot, so here it is my new journal &amp;hellip;
Moving forward I will add new post whenever I learn something interesting or I feel worth sharing, so no commitment.</description>
